# X-CUBE-IOTA1 Firmware Package
The X-CUBE-IOTA1 is an expansion software package for STM32Cube.
The software runs on the STM32 and includes includes the middleware 
for enabling the IOTA Distributed Ledger Technology. The expansion 
is built on STM32Cube software technology to ease portability across 
different STM32 microcontrollers. The software comes with sample 
implementations on how to use the IOTA middleware on the STM32 based 
boards.

**X-CUBE-IOTA1 software features**:

- Complete firmware to build IOTA DLT applications for STM32-based boards
- Middleware libraries featuring STSAFE secure element to have a secure hardware root of trust; WiFi management; encryption, hashing, message authentication and digital signing (Cryptolib); transport-level security (MbedTLS); IOTA Client API for interacting with the Tangle
- Complete driver to build applications accessing Motion and Environmental sensors
- Examples to help understanding how to develop an IOTA DLT Client application
- Example to help understand how to build and send to the Tangle an encrypted, authenticated message stream based on L2Sec, a Layer 2 lightweight security protocol designed for embedded IoT devices
- Easy portability across different MCU families, thanks to STM32Cube
- Free, user-friendly license terms

The figure below shows the overall architecture.
